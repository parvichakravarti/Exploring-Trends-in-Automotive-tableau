 ## Project Description

 This project involved creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize and analyze used car sales data. The key goals were to:

- Provide insights into sales trends over time
- Compare performance by transmission, fuel type, ownership etc.
- Analyze sales and pricing by different car segments
- Identify relationships between mileage, age and pricing
- Enable data-driven decision making for inventory, pricing and marketing

The dashboard combines used car listing data from various sources. It allows slicing and dicing - the data by relevant dimensions using filters and parameters.

Key visualizations include:

- Sales price trends over time
- Analysis of average pricing, mileage by fuel type, transmission
- Used car volume by dealer type, owner types
- Correlation analysis between pricing factors
- Forecasting of future pricing based on trends
